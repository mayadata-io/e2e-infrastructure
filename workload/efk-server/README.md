This folder contains the yaml files for fluentd(forwarder and aggregator), elasticsearch and kibana that runs on main cluster. Forwarder collect logs form the cluster and send to aggregator. Aggregator then send the logs to elasticsearch running on same cluster. Elasticsearch also receives logs from other fluentd-aggregators running on another cluster. Ultimately, Kibana visualizes the logs by reading the logs stored in Elasticsearch DB.
